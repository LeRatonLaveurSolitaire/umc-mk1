# Universal Motor Controller mk1 (UMC-mk1)
This is the repository of a universal motor controller (like washing machine motor) based on a arduino nano, a encoder for speed selection, I2C LCD screen for displaying data and a dimmer module for command. A PID loop enable a precise control of the motor. The speed is mesured from the tachometer and filterd by a LM358P.
