# Universal Motor Controller mk1 (UMC-mk1)
A simple universal motor controller (made for a washing machine motor) based around a arduino nano ÂµC. 
A PID loop close loop control enable a precise control of the motor speed. The speed is mesured from the tachometer and filterd by a LM358P.

# Speed detection

The motor speed is detected with the motor tachometer trimed between 0 and 5V by the LM358p and captured using the Timer 1 and interuptions.

# PID

The PID variables can be changed at the beggening of the scetch in order to obtain the wanted behavior

# Fire control

The thriac activation is controled by the Timer 2 with the OCR2A as control variable
